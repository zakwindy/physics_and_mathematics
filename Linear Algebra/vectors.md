#### Different definitions
- For a physics student, this is an arrow pointing in space. Any vector with the same direction and magnitude is identical.
- For a computer scientist, vectors are ordered lists of numbers.
- For a mathematician, a vector is anything where there's a sensible notion of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number. 
- For now, imagine a vector as something in the xy-plane with the tail sitting at the origin. 
#### Vector operations
- $\vec{v} + \vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 + w_1 \\ v_2 + w_2 \end{bmatrix}$
- Scaling a vector (squishing it, lengthening it, just changing the magnitude but not the direction), is done with [[scalars]], i.e. $2\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2x \\ 2y \end{bmatrix}$
